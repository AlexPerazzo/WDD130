Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/ffffff-000000" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/ffffff-000000</a>

      <p>
        People will want to come to this site to find important stats about specific players. It can be tough to manually sift through all the stats on your own, even with resources like braacket.com. This website allows all the most important stats to be found and displayed in an easy to read manner. The website will answer the two most important questions for ranking players: What are the most important stats? And what are those stats on this specific player? These stats will allow the visitors to be more informed on their favorite players, and to understand further why players are ranked the way they are on the official Player Rankings. The players whose stats are being displayed can also use this as a resource to see what their worst losses are so they know where they need to focus on to get better.
